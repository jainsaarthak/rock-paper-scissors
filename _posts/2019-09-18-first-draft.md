# Do the simplest thing that could possibly work

Simplicity is important. Always. Specially in early stages of a Software Project. You might not know what your customer will think about your system; or customers might think they know what they need and start telling you the solution they want, instead of telling you about the problem; or you just want to tackle a problem, a new programming language.

Start simple and make sure you get a better picture of the problem. Sometimes you have to write a bit of the solution to better understand the problem. You might need the customers to take a look on your solution to see if their problem is being solved.


## What do I want?

I want a simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. I want to lead you through the development of the system pointing out my discoveries, techniques and experience.


## How does the simplest version of the game look like?
